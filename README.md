Pull Requests welcome as you'd expect.

Articles go in the content folder.  You'll need a TOML front-matter section (copy one of the others). The 'Hugo' theme used [its own
shortcodes](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/docdock/shortcodes/) if you wish to go beyond markdown. Hugo uses [blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday) markdown syntax.

# Rules

1. This is a parody site. It is as if it was written in a parallel universe, where the inverse of all Agile/XP, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery/Deployment, DevOps, Lean, critical path/chain things are true. In fact, those never happened in this universe, so cannot be mentioned.

2. Nothing snide, sarcastic, ironic. No in-jokes. Just a matter-of-fact ([synonyms](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/matter-of-fact) (dictionary)[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/matter-of-fact]) style, please.
