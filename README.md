Pull Requests welcome as you'd expect.

Articles go in the content folder.  You'll need a TOML front-matter section (copy one of the others). The 'Hugo' theme used [its own
shortcodes](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/docdock/shortcodes/) if you wish to go beyond markdown. Hugo uses [blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday) markdown syntax.

# Rules

1. This is a parody site. It is as if it was written in a parallel universe, where the **inverse** of all these are true:
* Agile/XP
* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Delivery/Deployment
* DevOps
* Lean
* Critical path/chain concepts

In fact, those never happened in this universe, so cannot be mentioned. Source Control exists. Builds exist. Testing is better done
manually of course, and as close to go-live as possible.

2. Nothing snide or dripping with sarcastic. No 'in' jokes please. Just a matter-of-fact ([synonyms](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/matter-of-fact), [dictionary](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/matter-of-fact)) style, please.
