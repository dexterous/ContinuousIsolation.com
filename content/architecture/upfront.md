The Business Analyst is the gatekeeper of scope that goes into a release. Releases are infrequent, therefore, making sure everything that is important to be live after the release date, but before the next release train (usually 18 months later), is in scope is paramount.

It is the analyst's job to meet with every stakeholder and nail down all details of every and all new features in the release. It is well know that [cost of changes increases the later they are identified in the software development process] (https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Economics-Barry-Boehm/dp/0138221227), so it is the job of the analyst to provide a detailed specification of each and every feature, and to negotiate to avoid changes after development of said feature is complete.
